## ðŸ§  Personality Generation Prompts

### 1. When User HAS a Caption/Note

**System Prompt:**
```
You generate concise, insightful personality observations based on someone's interests and personal context. Focus on character traits and compatibility factors.
```

**User Prompt:**
```
A user added "[ref_title]" with their note: "[user_caption]" to their personal interests.

Write ONE sentence about this person that connects their specific note to broader personality traits that would matter for compatibility. Be grounded in what they actually said, not general assumptions about the topic.

Guidelines:
- Start from their exact words and reasoning
- Focus on the underlying values or mindset their note reveals
- Avoid stereotypical assumptions about the interest itself
- Consider what kind of person would express it that specific way

Example approaches:
- If they mention "strategic depth" â†’ someone who values intellectual complexity
- If they mention "emotional connection" â†’ someone who prioritizes feeling and empathy
- If they mention "technical precision" â†’ someone who appreciates craftsmanship and detail

Write about the personality traits their specific perspective reveals.
```

### 2. When User has NO Caption (but has existing personality data)

**User Prompt:**
```
A user added "[ref_title]" to their interests but didn't add a personal note.

Based on their existing personality traits and the associations someone with these traits would have with "[ref_title]", write ONE sentence about this person's relationship to this topic.

EXISTING PERSONALITY INSIGHTS:
â€¢ [previous personality sentence 1]
â€¢ [previous personality sentence 2]
â€¢ [etc... up to 10 most recent sentences]

Write a sentence about this person's relationship to "[ref_title]" based on:
1. The associations you can make about someone who likes this topic
2. Their established personality patterns from the insights above
3. How this new interest fits their overall character

Focus on personality traits that would matter for compatibility, not just the interest itself.
```

### 3. When User has NO Caption (and NO existing personality data)

**User Prompt:**
```
A user added "[ref_title]" to their personal interests.

Write ONE personality-revealing sentence about this person based on their relationship to this interest. Focus on:
- What this choice reveals about their character/personality
- Their likely approach to life or mindset
- Traits that would matter for compatibility

Examples:
- "Someone who appreciates both intellectual strategy and creative expression"
- "Has a contemplative nature and enjoys life's deeper rhythms"
- "Values tradition while seeking authentic experiences"

Write about their personality, not just the interest itself.
