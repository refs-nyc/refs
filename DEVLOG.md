- [ ] Implement a basic search so the search bar does something
- [ ] Universal links for easy sharing of profile / profile item

  28.12.2024
  Created a bunch of fixes
  New data structure to add notes and type on refs
  Moved the type field to the ref instead of on the item.
  An item can now have a boolean that says it's a list.

  LAST DAY:

  1. Univeral links
  2. Notifications

UI: we now wrap the entire app in a `<KeyboardAvoidingView>` component, so we can always be sure that the content we are currently interfacing with, moves up

Make sure the UI is authorized properly

<!-- Steps -->

1. [ ] Register push token into database
2. [ ] Share profile link
3. [ ] Homepage search results
4. [ ] Ability to post a url
5. [ ] More opinionated folders and so on

BTW
